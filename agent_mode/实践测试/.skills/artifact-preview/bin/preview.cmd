rem Windows entry point for artifact-preview (POSIX invokes ./bin/preview).
rem bin/preview is an extension-less shebang script. Windows does not read
rem shebangs, so executing it directly raises WinError 193; this launcher
rem hands it to the interpreter instead. %~dp0 is this file's own directory,
rem so the call works from any working directory.
