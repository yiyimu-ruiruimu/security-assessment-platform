rem Windows entry point for verifier-hub (POSIX invokes ./bin/verifier).
rem bin/verifier is an extension-less shebang script. Windows does not read
rem shebangs, so executing it directly raises WinError 193; this launcher
rem hands it to the interpreter instead. %~dp0 is this file's own directory,
rem so the call works from any working directory.
